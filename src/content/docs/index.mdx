## Introduction

Imprint CSS is a plugin for <ExternalLink name="Tailwind CSS v3.x"/> that adds easy-to-read typgraphy CSS styles to your Tailwind CSS project.

It is [licensed under the 3-clause BSD license](license). [Contributions](contributing) are welcome.

## Why Use Imprint CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a popular <ExternalLink name="Tailwind CSS Utility-First" text="utility-first CSS framework"/>. It provides a large number of CSS classes that you can apply directly to your HTML elements, so that you can quickly style individual elements in your HTML.

It's a great choice for web-based applications, where individual components may be defined separately. And it's also a great choice for content-oriented websites (blogs, project documentation, teaching material, etc etc). It just needs a bit of help to make it easy to use with your content.

Tailwind CSS comes with its own CSS reset rules. These reset rules strip even the most basic styling from the HTML elements that we use when writing content (such as headings, paragraphs, links, pre-formatted text, and so on).

That's a bit of a problem, especially if you're generating content from something like Markdown.

Imprint CSS gives you easy-to-read typography that works well on a range of devices. Add a couple of CSS classes, and you're done.
