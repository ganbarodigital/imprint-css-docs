# Inspirations

## Introduction

Like programming languages, these days it feels that CSS toolkits borrow to a lesser or greater extent from the ideas of each other. ImprintCSS is no exception, and I want to acknowledge where I have drawn our inspiration from.

## Main Inspirations

<p className="p--leader">My main source of inspiration is the team behind the BBC's approach to responsible CSS.</p>

* The BBC GEL gets my top shoutout. Their approach to typography was the inspiration for creating ImprintCSS in the first place. I've also adopted their concept of [device groups](concepts/device-groups.html). I feel that it's a great way to provide great-looking content on any device.

* The BBC NEWS site has also been a major influence. I feel that they led the way on multi-device support.

## Other Shouts

<p className="p--leader">Here's a list of other places from the 'net that I've relied on heavily to build and maintain ImprintCSS.</p>

In no particular order, they include:

* The MDN. MDN is our go-to reference for all things CSS. They do a great job of making the CSS standards and features understandable.

* The project's [contributing guidelines](../contributing) are based on [the ones used by the Angular JS project](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
