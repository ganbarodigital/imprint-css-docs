## Quick Reference

### CSS Classes

<CssStylesTable styleName="default-font-size" excMediaQueries={true} wrapNames={false}/>

### CSS Variables

There are three main types of CSS variable used for the default font size CSS styles.

* `--imprint-fontsize-root-base` holds the base value for `1rem`. The media queries above override its default value.
* `--imprint-fontsize-root-zoom` can be used to implement a font zoom control on your page.
* `--imprint-fontsize-root-<screen-name>`, where `<screen-name>` is the name of one of Imprint CSS's [custom breakpoints](../sizing/screens), are used by the media queries above.

## What Problem Are We Solving Here?

<Callout icon="idea">
We want our content to be equally readable on all devices. We achieve that by using different default font sizes on each device.
</Callout>

Historically, websites have gone with a single font size across all devices. Unfortunately, that causes text to look too large on some devices, and too small on others. These sites _do_ still work, they're just not as readable as they could be on all devices.

Yes, readers can increase or decrease their browser's font-size if they want to. Wouldn't it be better if they didn't have to? Wouldn't it be nicer if your content-oriented website was very readable on first load - i.e. it just worked?

## Basic Usage

### For The Whole Page

Use the `imprint-fontsize-root` class to set the value of `1rem` for your HTML document.

<BasicExample>
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

html {
    @apply imprint-fontsize-root;
}
```
</BasicExample>

### For Individual Elements

You can't use `imprint-fontsize-root` to set the base font size for individual parts of your HTML document.

Everything in Imprint CSS uses `rem` (root element) units for sizing. You can only set the value of `1rem` for your whole HTML document.

## Customising The Default Font Size

### In Your Main CSS File

You can override the default values for any of the `imprint-fontsize-root-*` CSS variables in your main CSS file:

<BasicExample>
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

:root {
    /* override font size for screen 'c-d' */
    --imprint-fontsize-root-c-d: 14px;
}
```
</BasicExample>

This will change all font sizes, and all spacing units, whenever the corresponding media query is matched.

## How Does It Work?

### Different Font Sizes For Different Screens & Devices

Imprint CSS uses <ExternalLink name="Mozilla MDN Media Queries" text="CSS media queries"/> to set the value of `--imprint-fontsize-root-base` for each of the supported [screens and devices](../sizing/screens.mdx).

This is used by `imprint-fontsize-root` to set the value of `1rem` for your HTML page.
