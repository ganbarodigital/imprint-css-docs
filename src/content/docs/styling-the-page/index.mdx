## What Styling Do You Need To Apply?

Content-oriented websites need three things styling:

1. [which font to use](/styling-the-page/font-faces),
2. [what size font to use](/styling-the-page/default-font-size), and
3. [what colors to use for the text and background](/styling-the-page/default-page-colors)
