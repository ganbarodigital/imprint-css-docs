## Introduction

Imprint CSS provides:

* default styling for the entire page,
* styling for typography,
* styling for tables,
* and a large collection of colors

## Setting Default Styling For The Entire Page

In your CSS file, add the following CSS rules.

<BasicExample>
```css
html {
    @apply imprint-font-sans-serif imprint-fontsize-root;
}

body {
    @apply imprint;
}
```
</BasicExample>

This will set:

* the default font for the entire page,
* the right value for `1 rem` for the reader's device, and
* the default colors for text and page background.

See [Styling The Page](/styling-the-page/) for in-depth details about this.

## Adding Styling For Typography

### Typography Choices

Imprint CSS comes with two different styles of typography:

CSS Class        | Style                                  | Description
-----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------
`imprint-modern` | [modern styling](/modern-typography/)  | Easy-to-read styling for the web.
`imprint-formal` | [formal styling](/formal-typography/)  | A more classical style for white papers and other formal works.

Imprint CSS doesn't automatically apply either of these styles to your project. You need to pick which one you want to use.

### Applying Your Choice Of Typography

You can add the CSS class to the `<body>` element:

<BasicExample>
```html
<body class="imprint-modern">
    ...
</body>
```
</BasicExample>

This will apply default your preferred typography style to every element in your HTML document.

If you want more fine-grained control, you can add the CSS class just to the parts of the page where you want the typography styles to apply:

<BasicExample>
```html
<article class="imprint-modern">
    ...
</article>
```
</BasicExample>
