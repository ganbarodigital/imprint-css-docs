## Quick Summary

Imprint CSS introduces some new tools to help your content-oriented website be equally readable on all devices:

* [device-aware CSS breakpoints](/sizing/screens) for adapting layouts to smart phones, popular tablets, desktop machines and laptops;
* [root pixels (`rpx`)](/sizing/root-pixels) for font sizes, line heights, widths, heights and the like;
* named [type sizes](/sizing/type-sizes) are also available for custom text sizing.

These are all built on top of Tailwind CSS.
