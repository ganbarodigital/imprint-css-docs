# Goals

## Introduction

ImprintCSS is a responsive CSS toolkit for styling and building content-oriented websites.

It is designed and developed by Stuart Herbert, and built as a plugin for Tailwind v3.4.

## Project Goals

### High-Quality Presentation For Web-based Docs Wherever You're Reading

When someone wants to read about something, they're going to use the device that's in front of them / in their hand there and then. They're very unlikely to seek out the 'right' device just to read a website.

First and foremost, ImprintCSS delivers CSS styling that works just as well on mobile, tablet, laptop or desktop.

### High-Quality Presentation For Web-based Docs For Whoever Is Reading

Today, we live in a society where just about everyone is expected to use the web. The web needs to work for everyone, regardless of age or disability.

ImprintCSS delivers CSS styling that works just as well for people who are partially sighted.
