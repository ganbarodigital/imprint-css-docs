## Introduction

You can use several standard HTML5 elements to tell the user what to type into their Terminal or their IDE of choice.

HTML Tag | Purpose
---------|--------
`<kbd>`  | for individual keyboard sequences
`<code>` | for inline code to type, or to refer to filenames or commands
`<samp>` | to show expected output, inline inside a paragraph
`<pre>`  | for larger blocks of input

We also support the deprecated `<tt>` tag, and treat it as an alias for the `<code>` tag.

## Keyboard Input

Use the HTML5 `<kbd>` element whenever you want the user to press one or more keys: <kbd>kbd</kbd> is sized to sensibly fit inside a long paragraph of text like this one, even on smaller devices with limited screen space.

* `<kbd>` uses several shadows to appear more like a physical keyboard key. This is done entirely with CSS.
* It uses the same font as the main content. This improves readability over a monospace font.
* It uses a heavier font. This draws the reader's attention to the keyboard input.

Some examples of `<kbd>` in use:

* Press the <kbd>esc</kbd> key to close the menu.
* Press <kbd>?</kbd> at any time to see the available keyboard shortcuts.
* Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> (or <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> on an Apple Mac) to copy to your clipboard.

## Inline Code

Use `<code>` inside a paragraph when you need to wrap a filename, function name, and so on. `<code>` is sized to sensibly fit inside a long paragraph of text like this one.

* The function `exit()` should never be used in a PHP application.

## Teletype Text

If you still use the older (and deprecated!) <ExternalLink name="Mozilla MDN HTML Element Teletype Text" text="Teletype Text"/> `<tt>` tag, this will work too.

* The Telnet client should display: <tt>Local Echo is on</tt>.

If you want to replace your `<tt>` tags with `<span>` elements instead, use the `.imprint-code` utility class:

* The Telnet client should display: <span class="imprint-code">Local Echo is on</span>.

## Inline Software Output

Use the `<samp>` block whenever you have output to show.

* If you run the `echo $HOME` command, the output is <samp>/Users/stuart</samp>.

In practice, `<samp>` is rarely used.

## A Basic &lt;pre&gt; Block

Use a basic `<pre>` block whenever you have input and/or output to show.

<pre class="!--imprint-primary">This is a &lt;pre&gt; block written directly in HTML.</pre>

`<pre>` blocks get the same background as [the basic panel](../components/panels.html#a-basic-panel) does.

If you use <code>```</code> code fences in Markdown / MDX files, these will always have syntax highlighting applied to them.
