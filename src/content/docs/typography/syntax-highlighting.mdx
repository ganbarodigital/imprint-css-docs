## Introduction

ImprintCSS assumes that any `<pre><code>...</code></pre>` HTML blocks are (possibly) syntax-highlighted code.

There's quite a few tools out there for generating these syntax-highlighting blocks, such as [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org), [prism.js](https://prismjs.com) and [shiki.js](https://shiki.style). They're all different, and they all produce different HTML output.

As a result, it simply isn't safe for ImprintCSS to apply much default styling for syntax-highlighted code.

## Default Styling

The only default CSS that ImprintCSS adds to syntax-highlighted code is to make sure that the font-size matches the rest of the document:

<div class="imprint-callout --primary">
```css
pre:has(code) {
    font-size: var(--imprint-inline-mono-size);
}
```
</div>

You'll need to write your own additional CSS if you want to change the default look and feel of your syntax-highlighting tool of choice.

That's exactly what we've done for this website.

## Astro + Shiki Style Examples

This website is built using [Astro](https://astro.build). Most of the web pages are generated from MDX files. The code examples are all generated from [standard Markdown <code>&grave;&grave;&grave;</code> code fence blocks](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/#fenced-code-blocks) using [shiki.js](https://shiki.style).

In this section, you'll find all the additional CSS and HTML markup that this site uses to produce the code examples.

### Setting The Background

The background is set using this CSS in this website's main CSS file:

<div class="imprint-callout --primary">
```css
.astro-code {
    @apply p-4su;
    background-image: url("/assets/blueprint-moz.png");
    background-repeat: repeat;
}
```
</div>

The background image originally came from [Mozilla's MDN website](https://developer.mozilla.org) circa 2015. MDN's content is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 2.5](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/).

### Adding The Left-Hand Divider Line

All of the code examples are wrapped in a `<div class="imprint-callout">` outer `<div>`. This adds the vertical line that you see on the left-hand side of each code example.

<div class="imprint-callout --primary">
```html
<div class="imprint-callout --primary">
    <!-- put your ``` code fence here if you are using Markdown / MDX -->
</div>
```
</div>

This is a great example of the benefits of a utility-first approach to CSS. In the past, we would have written unique CSS for this. Now, we just apply our block formatting style-mod of choice - no extra CSS required.

### Phix Light Color Scheme

The syntax-highlighting theme is called "Phix Light". It's designed to match the default colors of ImprintCSS.

It gets loaded into the website's `astro.config.mjs` config file (no extra CSS needed ðŸŽ‰), and produces results like this:

<div class="imprint-callout --primary">
```php
/**
 * this is an example
 */

namespace GanbaroDigital\Examples;

class ExampleClass
{
    const EXAMPLE_CONSTANT = null;

    public function __construct($arg1, $arg2)
    {
        // do something here
    }
}
```
</div>

### Adding Line Numbers

<div class="imprint-alert --shaded">
    <h4>Shiki Does Not Support Line Numbering</h4>
    <div class="imprint-inner">
        <p>At the time of writing, Shiki doesn't support adding line numbers to syntax-highlighted code. For more details, see <a href="https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/issues/3">this Github issue</a>.</p>
    </div>
</div>

There are workarounds available in pure CSS:

1. make Shiki's output act like a HTML ordered list, or
2. use CSS counters to add numbers to the `::before` pseudo element of every line.

We've gone with the first option. It has a big advantage: when readers copy and paste examples, the line numbers don't get copied across. (HTML ordered list numbers cannot be selected by dragging the mouse.)

ImprintCSS comes with a `--shiki-numbered` [style mod](/style-mods/), so that you don't have to write this CSS yourself.

Wrap your syntax-highlighted code in a `<div class="--shiki-numbered">` outer `<div>`.

<div class="imprint-callout --primary --shiki-numbered">
```html
<div class="imprint-callout --primary --shiki-numbered">
<!-- start your ``` code fence if using Markdown / MDX -->
    <div class="panel">
    This is a basic panel component.
    </div>
<!-- end your ``` code fence if using Markdown / MDX -->
</div>
```
</div>

You can customise `--shiki-numbered` by overriding the following CSS variables in your Tailwind config file, or in your own CSS styles.

`--imprint-code-example-line-no-color` | Sets the color of line numbers added to syntax-highlighted code examples
