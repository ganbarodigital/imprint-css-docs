# Zero-Effort Typography

## Introduction

Websites typically fall into two major camps:

- web-based applications
- content publishing

Modern CSS frameworks (like Tailwind) have the first camp well and truly covered. And we get it: apps are sexy, while content is not. But content is important too:

- if you are trying to attract an audience, it's your content that pulls people in
  - search engines index and catalog content, not functionality
  - people search for knowledge and information, not functionality
- if you are trying to share what you know, your content needs to be presentable _wherever_ people are reading it
  - people should be able to read your content

The web was invented as a way to easily share knowledge with strangers. It should be just as easy to make your content look good too.

## Types Of Content

Imprint CSS

1. prose (e.g. blog articles, books)
2. technical documentation (e.g. open-source project docs)
3. formal content (e.g. white papers, green papers, and research papers)
