# Convenience Framework

## Introduction

Although it's built on top of a utility-first framework (the excellent Tailwind CSS), Imprint CSS isn't a utility-first framework. It's actually a "convenience-first" framework.

What do we mean by that?

## Two Classes And You're Done

To style your content, all you need to do is to add two CSS classes to your HTML markup ...

<div class="imprint-callout --primary">
```html
<html>
    <head>
        ...
    </head>
    <body class="imprint">
        <main class="imprint-prose">
        </main>
    </body>
</html>
```
</div>

... and you're done.

* The `imprint` class activates the CSS rules that are common across all the supported content styles,
* and the `imprint-prose` class activates the CSS rules that are specific for the prose content type.

Publishing a different type of content? You can swap out `imprint-prose` for (say) `imprint-white-paper` to get that look instead.

## Customise Via Your Tailwind Config File

Whether it's CSS or code, we hate _hate_ **hate** working with "convention over configuration" frameworks that can't be adapted to suit the product or project we're working on. They're a creative straight-jacket, forcing the project to be designed around their baked-in limitations.

That's why all of Imprint CSS's styles are driven by CSS variables.
