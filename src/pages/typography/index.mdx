# Typography

ImprintCSS delivers beautiful typography designed to make your content look good and (visually at least!) a pleasure to read on mobile, tablet and desktop alike.

* [Headings](/typography/headings) and [paragraphs](/typography/paragraph-styles) - are styled for document-oriented content.
* [Lists](/typography/lists) come in the usual bullet-point and indexed styles, and are styled for report-like content.
* [Links](/typography/links) are styled to be instantly recognisable without being obtrusive.
* [Preformatted text, code and keyboard input instructions](/typography/preformatted-styles) also get the treatment.
* [Syntax-highlighted code](/typography/syntax-highlighting) is styled to fit the rest of your page.
